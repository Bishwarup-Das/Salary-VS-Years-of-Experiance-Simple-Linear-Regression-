## Introduction

The relationship between years of experience and salary is a common topic in the field of human resources and job market analysis. This project utilizes a simple linear regression model to explore and model this relationship. The goal is to create a predictive model that can estimate salaries based on the number of years of experience a person has.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of two columns: "Years of Experience" and "Salary". Each row represents an individual's years of experience and their corresponding salary. This dataset is used to train and evaluate the linear regression model.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bishwarup-Das/Salary-VS-Years-of-Experiance-Simple-Linear-Regression-.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Salary-VS-Years-of-Experiance-Simple-Linear-Regression-
```

## Usage

1. After installing the dependencies, you can run the main script:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the linear regression model, and generate predictions.

## Results

The project aims to achieve the following:

- Load and understand the dataset.
- Preprocess the data if necessary.
- Train a simple linear regression model.
- Evaluate the model's performance.
- Visualize the linear regression line and the data points.

The results will include visualizations that show the linear regression line fitted to the data points, as well as metrics such as mean squared error to assess the model's predictive accuracy.
